# To Do List in React

I have created a React application for creating a to-do list. It allows adding tasks with a due date and an optional priority flag. Tasks can be sorted by date, alphabetically, or by priority. The application enables editing, deleting, and marking tasks as completed. Completed tasks can be restored to the to-do list or permanently deleted.
